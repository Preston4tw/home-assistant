# Home Assistant

This repo holds my Home Assistant yaml files.

## TODO
- Review [Home Assistant Best Practices](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-best-practices/27630)
- CI to validate YAML file changes on commit
  - Might be able to use this: https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config/blob/master/.github/workflows/home-assistant.yml
- Automatic git pull / sync
- Figure something out for secrets.yaml
- Review/adapt/adopt the [circadian rhythm lighting automation blueprint](https://gist.github.com/dimkaram/39cfe8e996aaa7f3fe3727495b120ce5)
- Maybe add a CO2 sensor
- Maybe add IoT blinds
- Maybe VPN for access when not at home
